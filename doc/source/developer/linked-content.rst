Linked content for a project
============================

For classroom use, it is helpful for students to be able to start work
on an existing *specimen* of code.  Their task might be to modify it
in some way, or answer some questions about how it works.

A Pytch project, as stored in the user's project list, therefore has
*linked content*, which can be of various kinds.  There is a
``"none"`` kind to represent the case where there is no linked
content.  Currently the only other kind of linked content is
``"specimen"``, although it's possible that tutorial content will be
folded into this model in the future.
