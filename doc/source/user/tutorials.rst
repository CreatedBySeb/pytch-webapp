TODO: Fill in structure of below.

* Pytch comes with several tutorials
* These introduce you to different ideas of working in Python
* See choice by clicking on *Tutorials* in the top bar
* Click on a tutorial to create a project letting you work through
  that tutorial; sets up any graphics and sounds needed
* Table of contents down left, or navigate with next / previous
  buttons
* Tutorial leads you through writing the Python code; changes to the
  code shown as *diffs* (will need explanation)
* Usually better to type in code yourself, but sometimes there are
  large boring bits; can use the *COPY* button to make this easier
