Using the Pytch web app
=======================

The Pytch web app has three main areas:

* The *code editor*, where you write the Python code for your project.
* The *stage*, which is very much like Scratch's stage, and is where
  your project runs.
* The *information area*, which allows you to work with your project's
  images or sounds, and also shows you any text output your project
  prints, and any errors your project encounters.

If you project is following a tutorial, the tutorial content is part
of the information area too.

TODO: Write the rest of this.
