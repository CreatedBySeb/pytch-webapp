Writing and building your code
==============================

In Pytch, you describe what you want the Sprites in your project to do
by writing Python code.

You write and edit your Python program in the top-left panel.  Unlike
Scratch, where changes take effect straight away, in Python you must
*build* your program first.  In Pytch, this is done with the *BUILD*
button above the stage.  Compiling can take a few seconds for a
complicated program.  If there are errors in your program, a
description of the problem will appear in the ‘Errors’ tab of the
information pane.

It is a good idea to save your project's code often, with the *Save*
button above the stage.  It is highlighted when there are unsaved
changes in your program.


TODO: Fill in structure of below.

* The *code editor* is what Pytch has instead of Scratch's scripts area
* Python uses indentation as part of what your code means; the editor
  will help you with this
* The code is part of your project; you have to *SAVE* it to avoid
  losing work; this happens every time you *BUILD* as well
