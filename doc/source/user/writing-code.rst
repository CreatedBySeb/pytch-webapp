Writing and running your code
=============================

In Pytch, you describe what you want the Sprites in your project to do
by writing Python code.

You write and edit your Python program in the top-left panel.  Unlike
Scratch, where changes take effect straight away, in Python there is
the idea of *starting your program*.  (TODO: Settle on a good word for
this.  "Launch"?)

To start your program, click the green flag.  If there are errors in
your program which mean it can't start, a description of the problem
will appear in the ‘Errors’ tab of the information pane.  If there are
no errors, the "green flag" event happens, which your Sprites can
respond to if they need to, for example, move to their starting
position.

It is a good idea to save your project's code often, with the *Save*
button above the stage.  It is highlighted when there are unsaved
changes in your program.


TODO: Fill in structure of below.

* The *code editor* is what Pytch has instead of Scratch's scripts area
* Python uses indentation as part of what your code means; the editor
  will help you with this
* The code is part of your project; you have to *SAVE* it to avoid
  losing work; this happens every time you *green-flag* as well
