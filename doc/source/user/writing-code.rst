Writing and building your code
==============================

TODO: Fill in structure of below.

* The *code editor* is what Pytch has instead of Scratch's scripts area
* Python uses indentation as part of what your code means; the editor
  will help you with this
* The code is part of your project; you have to *SAVE* it to avoid
  losing work; this happens every time you *BUILD* as well
* See also :doc:`running-your-program`
