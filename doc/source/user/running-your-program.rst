Running your project
====================

TODO: Fill in structure of below.

* Difference from Scratch: you have to *BUILD* your program after
  changing it
* Some things happen straight away on BUILD, like Stage showing its
  first Backdrop, Sprites appearing in the centre of the screen with
  their first Costume
* But usually your program responds to events like green-flag or a key
  being pressed
