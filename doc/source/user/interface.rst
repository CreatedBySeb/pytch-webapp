The Pytch web app
=================

TODO: Fill in structure of below.

The Pytch web app has three main areas:

* The *code editor*, where you write the Python code for your project.
* The *stage*, which is very much like Scratch's stage, and is where
  your project runs.
* The *information area*, which allows you to work with your project's
  images or sounds, and also shows you any text output your project
  prints, and any errors your project encounters.  If your project is
  following a tutorial, the tutorial content is part of the
  information area too.

TODO: Screenshots, more details.

* Working with graphics and sounds, or a tutorial, 'wide info pane' is
  more useful layout
* Once working mostly with code, 'tall code editor' layout more useful
