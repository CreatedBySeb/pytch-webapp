Errors in Pytch projects
========================

If there is an error in your Python program, this will be shown in the
‘Errors’ tab of the information pane.   The error report includes
clickable buttons to take you to the point in your code which caused
the problem.

TODO: Fill in structure of below.

* This is one big difference from Scratch, where your program never
  crashes.
* How best to explain the concept of build (maybe "launch" is a
  better word?) and runtime errors will need some thought.
* Your program can have problems at *launch time*, which means Pytch
  can't even start running your project.
* Or can have problems at *run time*, which are problems which only
  show up once your project is running.  Perhaps there is a problem
  which only shows up when one of your Sprites is clicked.
* When an error happens, Pytch stops your project completely so you
  can investigate.
* The problem is reported in the *Errors* tab of the info panel.
  Occasionally more than one error might happen at the same time; then
  they're all reported at once.
* Each error report explains what's happened, and gives you clickable
  buttons to take you to the places in your code causing the problem.

TODO: Suggestions about how to investigate when things go wrong.

Some errors are confusing; explain them here; e.g., *tuple not
callable* if you forget comma between one detailed Costume spec and
the next.
